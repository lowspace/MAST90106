## General comments
- could breakdown locations as manufacturing vs R&D
- how should wholly owned subsidiary companies fit into picture?
- how should corporate structures and implied ability to manipulate reported revenue figures fit into picture?

## YTEN
Operations in Saskatoon ~400km north of Montana (in Canada). 

We have financial data from 2004-now, but 2006 report has data from 2002. Previously Metabolix Inc. and may have been operating as far back as 1992.

## CGA
No connection to US --- would need climate data from China to include in study. Reliance on coal for fertiliser production may make it susceptible to climate factors.

## CTA-PA
Discuss with Wei.

## FMC
Annual reports do not mention locations, however company website and indeed.com allow us to infer current locations which is considered "good enough" for previous 10 years.

Majority of employees US based, however majority of revenue from international markets.

Lots of environmental issues in reports relating to environmental lawsuits and liabilities, including a section on Climate Change.

## MOS
Annual reports from 2011-now, however CFP data from 1988-now. Able to find worldwide locations from 2011-now in Sales and Distribution Activities section.

Own Archer Daniels Midlands Co., who do production for YTEN.
