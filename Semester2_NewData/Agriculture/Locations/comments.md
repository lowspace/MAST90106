## General comments
- could breakdown locations as manufacturing vs R&D
- how should wholly owned subsidiary companies fit into picture?
- how should corporate structures and implied ability to manipulate reported revenue figures fit into picture?

## YTEN
Operations in Saskatoon ~400km north of Montana (in Canada). 

We have financial data from 2004-now, but 2006 report has data from 2002. Previously Metabolix Inc. and may have been operating as far back as 1992.

## CGA
No connection to US --- would need climate data from China to include in study. Reliance on coal for fertiliser production may make it susceptible to climate factors.

## CTA-PA, CTA-PB, and CTVA
Concerns with company documented [here](https://github.com/lowspace/MAST90106/issues/5). 

## FMC
Annual reports do not mention locations, however company website and indeed.com allow us to infer current locations which is considered "good enough" for previous 10 years.

Majority of employees US based, however majority of revenue from international markets.

Lots of environmental issues in reports relating to environmental lawsuits and liabilities, including a section on Climate Change.

## MOS
Annual reports from 2011-now, however CFP data from 1988-now. Able to find worldwide locations from 2011-now in Sales and Distribution Activities section.

Own Archer Daniels Midlands Co., who do production for YTEN.

## RKDA
Annual reports from 2015-now, CFP data from 2012-now, but founded 2002. Some location data is unclear (used for R&D trials) but overall data appears well-substantiated. How should we handle land ownership? They claim to lease farmland in various US states.

Majority of revenue from US, however big change in 2020 with 80+% of revenue now from Argentina.

## SEED
Majority of operations not in US. Had offices in Iowa for period 2016-2018, otherwise nothing.

## UAN
Operations in Illinois come online in 2015 as result of merger with Rentech. Reports clearly specify which states customers are in, but only operations are included in obtained company location data.
