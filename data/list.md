| [1.88 Million US Wildfires](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires) | This data publication contains a spatial database of wildfires that occurred in the United States from 1992 to 2015.|
| [Significant Earthquakes, 1965-2016](https://www.kaggle.com/usgs/earthquake-database) | This dataset includes a record of the date, time, location, depth, magnitude, and source of every earthquake with a reported magnitude 5.5 or higher since 1965. |
| [Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data) | Global Land and Ocean-and-Land Temperatures, repackaged the data from a newer compilation put together by the Berkeley Earth. |
| [Berkeley Earth](http://berkeleyearth.org/data/) | The datasets presented here have been divided into three categories: Output data, Source data, and Intermediate data. The Berkeley Earth averaging process generates a variety of Output data including a set of gridded temperature fields, regional averages, and bias-corrected station data. <br>Source data consists of the raw temperature reports that form the foundation of our averaging system. Source observations are provided as originally reported and will contain many quality control and redundancy issues. <br> Intermediate data is constructed from the source data by merging redundant records, identifying a variety of quality control problems, and creating monthly averages from daily reports when necessary. |
