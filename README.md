## Project Title
Investigate the relationship between climate events and corporate financial performance
## Project Describtion
With the increased presence of climate change discussions in everyday life, it has become apparent that climate events also impact the financial markets.
Each company is exposed to a sort of risk due to climate change, be it supply chain risk, operational risks or market risks. Some companies give an overview of the risks they face in their annual reports and discuss the impact on their business. However, the number of comprehensive discussions is limited. Moreover, the academic research on the relationship between climate events and stocks performance is also extremely limited. 
This project proposes to investigate the relationship between climate events and companies’ financial performance.
