# Review of Climate Risks and Market Efficiency

## Summary

* industry and company level
* climate change = drought, since it is easy to quantified and has a direct impact over food industry and relevant companies (justify by the authors)
* drought information can not influence stocks right now, a 3-year index has a power predictability
* proposed a cross-country strategy 

## Abstract

Topic: investigate whether stock markets efficiently price risks **brought on** or **exacerbated** by climate change

* climate change = drought
  * why drought? the most damaging natural disaster for crops and food-company cash flows
  * what kind of drought? prolonged drought
  * the range of prolonged drought? in a country
  * the measurement? the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) from climate studies
* stock markets price = food stocks
* relationship: prolonged drought in a country forecasts both declines in **profitability ratios** and **poor stock returns** for food companies in that country
* results:
  * a portfolio short food stocks of countries in drought and long those of countries not in drought generates a 9.2% annualized return from 1985 to 2015
  * excess predictability is larger in countries having little history of droughts prior to the 1980s

**Notes:**

1. from industry perspective over a country, instead of company view;
2. climate change is measured by one kind of disaster rather than a synthesized index of different disasters;
    * the duration of climate change should take into account, such as a prolonged change or just a crush
    * if we wanna use a synthesized index, the correlations among different indexes should take into account
3. market efficiency is measured by stock prices;
    * consider the predictability over different decades, and explain why
    * focus on one industry of a country, but not global

## Introduction

The below paper can be used in our introduction.
>Most notably, Mark Carney, the head of the Bank of England, recently linked these risks to financial stability (Carney (2015)).<sup>[[1]](#ft1)</sup>


How to choose climate change?
>Vulnerability of corporations’ production processes to natural disasters is also important and can impose significant damage to corporate profits.<sup>[[2]](#ft2)</sup>

Little research focus on this area: climate risks and market efficiency.

How the author tackle this topic? or what kind of view the authors use to highlight this topic?  

* market efficiency = stock prices of food companies;
* climate risks = information about drought
* relationship = *stock prices ~ drought*

Why drought? 

* among the natural disasters that might be amplified by climate
change, including drought, heat waves, floods, and cold spells, drought is considered one of the most devastating for economic production.<sup>[[3]](#ft3)</sup>
* a number of water engineering studies find that the food industry is the most reliant on water and hence the most sensitive to drought risk<sup>[[4]](#ft4)</sup>
*  drought is easy to quantify by using the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), a
widely used monthly metric in climate studies<sup>[[5]](#ft5)</sup>

Data:

* the time series of stock market
* the earliest start date is 1975 and much of our sample only begins in the early 1990s
* around 30 countries (including the US) with at least 10 food companies during the entire period

Dependent Variables:

* profitability ratios
* the returns of the FOOD industry of each country
  * Food industry = food processing and agricultural companies
  * why industry but not companies? drought is likely to have a direct impact on the profits of both food processing and agricultural companies.

**Notes:**

1. consider how the disasters impact the industry or the companies, such as whether the disasters pose the same influence on the industry
2. one disaster maybe sufficient for one industry, if we can prove or find research to support that. In this article, the authors argue drought has a direct impact on the profits of both food processing and agricultural companies, thus they can explore the relationship between drought and food stocks.


## The Model

Climate Change and Droughts:
*PDSI ~ time* to predict the drought trend

Stock and droughts:
*the future 1-year change in the food industry profitability ratio (CP) in each country ~ 36-month moving average of country-level PDSI values + a set of lagged predictors from the country’s stock market*

The above model is based on country, then we should construct cross-country portfolio strategy.

Similar to the returns of the FOOD industry of each country.

## Conclusion

* stock markets are inefficient with respect to information about prolonged drought => **can not reflect the influence right now**
* prolonged drought spells in a country, as measured by a 3-year moving average of PDSI, forecast poor returns for a portfolio comprised of food stocks in that country. => **prolonged drought can predict the portfolio of food stocks in a country**
